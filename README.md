# Project Motivation
 For this project, I was interested in using Airbnb Seattle data to better understand:
 - 1.What Airbnb houses are the most popular ones in market?
 - 2.What is the factor that related with the Airbnb price the most?
 - 3.Can we predict the price of Airbnb houses?

It is also a project for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program. This project aims to have a focus on the data science process.

# File Descriptions
listings.csv is part of Seattle Airbnb open data. It consists of various Airbnb homestay activities in Seattle area.
The dataset is aslo accessible here:https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data

# Result
[Using Machine learning to predict Values of homes on Airbnb.ipynb](https://github.com/minyansh7/CreatADataSciencePostwithCRISPDMProcess/blob/main/Using%20Machine%20learning%20to%20predict%20Values%20of%20homes%20on%20Airbnb.ipynb) is my  full code.

[Here](https://minyansh.blogspot.com/2021/06/use-data-science-to-predict-airbnb.html) is also my blog post that summarises the project findings.
