## 1. Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
 For this project, I was interested in using Airbnb Seattle data to better understand:
 - 1. What Airbnb houses are the most popular ones in market?
 - 2. What is the factor that related with the Airbnb price the most?
 - 3. Can we predict the price of Airbnb houses?

It is also a project for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program. This project aims to have a focus on the data science process.

## 2. File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
[listings.csv](https://github.com/minyansh7/CreatADataSciencePostwithCRISPDMProcess/blob/main/listings.csv) is part of Seattle Airbnb open data. It consists of various Airbnb homestay activities in Seattle area.

The dataset is accessible here:https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data

## 3. Result<a name="results"></a>
[Using Machine learning to predict Values of homes on Airbnb.ipynb](https://github.com/minyansh7/CreatADataSciencePostwithCRISPDMProcess/blob/main/Using%20Machine%20learning%20to%20predict%20Values%20of%20homes%20on%20Airbnb.ipynb) is my  full code.

[Here](https://minyansh.blogspot.com/2021/06/use-data-science-to-predict-airbnb.html) is also my blog post that summarises the project findings.

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and dexscriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).

Thanks to Kaggle and Udacity community's knowledge sharing that supports the project.
